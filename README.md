# Redis As DB

A .NET Web Api with full CRUD functionality using [Redis](https://redis.io/) as the main db.

## Start the app
Start the app by running <code>docker compose up -d</code> from the main folder. <br />
This will simply start the redis instance and the API as a container. You can then access the endpoints and API docs via http://localhost/swagger

## For development
If you don't have any other instance of [Redis](https://redis.io/) running you need to start the container as mentioned previously. <br />
You can then run the app from the IDE of your choice.
